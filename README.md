University of Essex

## Purpose of this repository
This repository hosts my academic e-portfolio for the Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Essex. The portfolio provides structured evidence of learning outcomes, coursework, reflections, and selected artefacts produced during the programme.

The e-portfolio is designed to complement formal assessments by demonstrating how academic theory is applied, reflected upon, and contextualised within professional practice.

## Structure
The repository is organised as follows:

- `index.html` – Main landing page
- `about-me.html` – Academic and professional background
- `modules/` – Module overviews, reflections, and evidence
- `documents/` – Supporting documents (reports, PDFs, certificates)
- `assets/` – Stylesheets and scripts (HTML5-UP theme)
- `images/` – Visual assets used throughout the portfolio

Each module page documents:
- Key learning objectives
- Relevant coursework and assignments
- Reflective commentary linking theory and practice
- References to supporting evidence where applicable

## Academic focus
This portfolio emphasises:
- Secure systems design
- Software engineering and architecture
- Cybersecurity and governance
- Critical reflection on technical decision-making

All content is written in UK English and aligned with academic expectations of postgraduate study.

## Maintenance
The portfolio is updated incrementally throughout the programme as modules are completed and assessed.
