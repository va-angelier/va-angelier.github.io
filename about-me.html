				<h1>About me</h1>
			</header>

			<p>
				My name is <strong>Victor Angelier</strong>, a Master’s student in Computer Science with extensive
				professional experience in software engineering, cybersecurity, and secure digital infrastructure.
				This e-portfolio accompanies my MSc studies and provides structured evidence of academic progress,
				practical work, and reflective learning.
			</p>

			<p>
				Prior to and alongside my academic studies, I have worked for more than two decades in complex and
				highly regulated IT environments, including government, telecommunications, finance, and high-tech
				industry. These contexts have shaped my interest in the intersection between software architecture,
				information security, governance, and operational reliability.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2>Professional background</h2>

			<p>
				My professional career spans roles such as software architect, security specialist, DevSecOps
				engineer, and technical project lead. In these roles, I have been responsible for designing and
				maintaining secure systems, automating infrastructure, and translating organisational and legal
				requirements into concrete technical solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				A recurring theme throughout my work is <em>security by design</em>. I have been involved in the
				implementation of cryptographic solutions, identity and access management, server hardening, and
				compliance with frameworks such as BIO, NIST, OWASP, and GDPR. More recently, my work has included
				post-quantum cryptography and secure data-sharing architectures within government environments.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2>Academic motivation</h2>

			<p>
				Although my professional background is extensive, I chose to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer
				Science to strengthen my theoretical foundation and formalise my knowledge within an academic
				framework. The MSc programme allows me to critically evaluate technologies I have previously applied
				in practice and to connect them with underlying theories, models, and research.
			</p>

			<p>
				In particular, I am interested in areas such as secure systems design, distributed systems,
				cryptography, and the socio-technical implications of digital infrastructure. The academic setting
				provides space for reflection, validation, and critical analysis that complements professional
				experience.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2>Purpose of this e-portfolio</h2>

			<p>
				This e-portfolio serves as a structured record of learning outcomes across the MSc programme. For
				each module, I document key concepts, assignments, and reflections, linking academic theory to
				practical application where appropriate.
			</p>

			<p>
				The portfolio is intentionally concise, evidence-based, and reflective. It is designed not only to
				demonstrate academic achievement, but also to show how learning outcomes contribute to professional
				growth, ethical awareness, and technical judgement.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<h2>Looking ahead</h2>

			<p>
				My academic and professional goal is to continue working at the intersection of technology,
				security, and governance, contributing to resilient and trustworthy digital systems. The MSc
				programme forms a critical step in aligning long-term professional practice with rigorous academic
				standards.
