# Collaborative Discussion 1: UML Flowchart

## Learning Outcomes
Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.
Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.

## Topic / assignment

Open source tools are available to create UML diagrams, some are listed below. This list is not exhaustive. The benefit of using such tools is that they ensure that the recognised UML components are used to represent the parts of the model correctly.

* Visual Paradigm
* Sequence Diagram
* Umbrello

Choose an open-source UML tool from the list above.  Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. Which UML models might you use to present the design of your proposed software, and why are they the most appropriate choice(s)?

## Umbrello
The UML activity diagram representing the steps leading to an OWASP A03: Injection vulnerability UML was generated programmatically using Python and exported as an image artefact.

## UML explained
A class diagram is used to model secure separation of responsibilities, a sequence diagram to demonstrate safe handling of user input at runtime, and a use case diagram to capture security-critical functionality, making these UML models the most appropriate for presenting a design that mitigates SQL injection.
