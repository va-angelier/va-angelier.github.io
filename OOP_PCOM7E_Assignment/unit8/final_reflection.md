# Final Reflection

This module has significantly enhanced my understanding of object-oriented (OO) design, Internet of Things (IoT), and socio-technical implications of digital transformation. Initially, I was adept at UML flowcharts and database designs but unfamiliar with PlantUML. Learning to generate and refine diagrams in PlantUML—e.g., a use case diagram for my humanoid robot model—improved my ability to produce consistent, reproducible academic artefacts, aligning with professional standards.

Engaging with Baskara et al. (2024) provided a structured baseline, illustrating how SDLC and OO methods translate into IoT prototypes like T-UFF, with clear flowcharts and use case diagrams (Baskara et al., 2024, p. 4–5). A key insight was the limitations of Bluetooth and LED technologies, which, while effective for proof-of-concept, lack scalability. I addressed this by designing improved models for humanoid robots, integrating LoRaWAN, RTLS, and edge AI, linking theory to current practice (Dang et al., 2023; Ray, 2018). This effort, supported by a 40–50% cost reduction estimate from edge AI efficiencies (Wang et al., 2025), highlighted the gap between academic proposals and technological feasibility.

Peer feedback encouraged a strategic focus, prompting me to connect technical choices to digital sovereignty (TNO, 2024, Report R10300) and sustainability. Writing the Initial Post and substantiating claims with references boosted my academic writing confidence, balancing concise arguments with evidence. Independent work fostered ownership, while peer discussions refined my thinking, emphasizing ethical dimensions.

Overall, this module deepened my critical thinking and ability to integrate OO design, IoT metamodels, and policy frameworks. These skills will support my academic and professional goals in designing secure, scalable digital systems.
