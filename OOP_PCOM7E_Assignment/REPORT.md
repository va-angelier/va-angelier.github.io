## Background Research

Research used “robot,” “human-robot interaction,” and “collaborative robot” to explore functionalities, interfaces, and collaboration (Mukherjee et al., 2022; Ackerman, 2023). Additional sources: Mulko (2023), Siciliano and Khatib (2016), Russell and Norvig (2020), Thrun et al. (2005).

## System Design Rationale

The system enables a humanoid robot for warehouse tasks: navigation, object manipulation, and human communication via a CLI (Mukherjee et al., 2022). Python’s object-oriented design ensures modularity, with a CLI chosen for simplicity (Ackerman, 2023). Classes are modeled with UML, using lists (e.g., `Environment.objects` for dynamic data), a dictionary (`object_index` for O(1) lookups), stacks (e.g., `Manipulator.graspHistory` for undo), and queues (e.g., `Navigation.pathQueue` for path steps) (Siciliano and Khatib, 2016). Power management uses state transitions (e.g., `OFF` to `IDLE` via `powerOn()`) to gate operations, avoiding complex concurrent logic (Thrun et al., 2005). A* (O(V log V + E)) optimizes navigation with obstacle avoidance over linear search for large grids (Russell and Norvig, 2020). **Trade-offs**: (1) State transitions simplify control but limit multitasking. (2) Dictionary lookup improves search speed but increases memory use. (3) A* adds complexity but enhances pathfinding. UML models, linter-optimized code, and tests ensure robustness (Derezińska, 2015).

## Learning Outcomes → Artefacts
| Learning Outcome | Artefact(s) | Hoe het bewijs levert |
|---|---|---|
| OO-modellering | Class diagram + `robot_system.py` | Cohesie per klasse; compositie Robot→(Nav/Manip/Comms/Memory); lage koppeling. |
| Gedrag & processen | State diagram; Activity (navigate/pick/errors) | Guards (battery<10%, no-path, timeout) mappen 1-op-1 op codepaden. |
| Program design & testing | Unit tests, coverage, flake8 | Edge cases (no-path, graspFail, low battery); deterministische asserts. |
| Architectuur & deployment | Component + Deployment | Scheiding Core/Nav/Manip; MCU vs PC; interfaces benoemd (Speech/Display/Sensors). |

## Critical Reflection
I prioritised composition over inheritance in the domain model: the Robot *has* Navigation, Manipulator, Communicator and MemoryStore. This avoids a God-class and keeps responsibilities testable and swappable. An alternative would have been a ROS-based decomposition with topic/services; I declined it to keep the assignment portable and to focus on core OO decisions (encapsulation, cohesion, coupling).

Navigation uses an A*-style planner because asymptotic behaviour matters when grids get larger; O(V log V + E) is a better ceiling than naïve search for pathfinding at scale (Russell & Norvig, 2020). The trade-off is implementation complexity and the need for a consistent environment model. I mitigated it with a thin `Environment.isObstacle()` API and unit tests that inject synthetic maps. A further alternative—D* Lite or probabilistic roadmaps—was rejected due to scope and determinism for testing.

Data-structure choices were deliberate: dictionary lookups for O(1) object access accelerate the “find and pick” loop, at the cost of memory overhead; stacks for grasp-history provide O(1) undo semantics aligned with user expectations; queues model FIFO path execution and command intake cleanly. These choices simplified reasoning in the activity/state diagrams and produced assertions that are easy to automate.

Error handling is first-class: explicit `ERROR` state with guards (battery<10%, timeout, graspFail) and recovery back to `IDLE`. This mirrors how operators think about robots (safe gating before retry) and enables targeted tests. A limitation is the lack of true concurrency: sensing and motion are sequenced, not overlapped. If extended, I would introduce an event loop with non-blocking IO and a state supervisor, then adapt the sequence diagram to show concurrent lifelines.

In practice, this design is immediately applicable to warehouse-like tasks where predictable, deterministic behaviour and testability outweigh raw optimality. Future work: add a charging sub-state machine, sensor fusion for noisy inputs, and a pluggable planner interface (Strategy) to make A* replaceable.

## Evidence of Independent Working (20%)

**Planning & scope (zelfstandig):**
- Doel & artefacten gedefinieerd: UML-set, Python-implementatie, tests.
- Mijlpalen: [MM-DD] UML → [MM-DD] code → [MM-DD] tests → [MM-DD] polishing.

**Uitvoering (zelf gedaan):**
- Modules: `robot_system.py`, Navigation/Manipulator/Communicator/MemoryStore, CLI.
- UML: class, sequence, activity (navigate/pick/errors), state, component, deployment, use-case.

## Traceability
| Use-case | Sequence | Activity/State | Component/Deployment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Navigate to (x,y) | `sequence_diagram.puml` (navigate section) | Activity “navigation_activity_diagram”; State `IDLE→MOVING→IDLE/ERROR` | Components: Core, Navigation, Planner, Controller; Deployment: Robot PC + Sensor Bus |
| Pick object | `sequence_diagram.puml` (pick section) | Activity “activity_diagram-pickup”; State `IDLE→MANIPULATING→IDLE/ERROR` | Components: Core, Manipulator, Grasp Planner, MCU |
| Handle error | `sequence_diagram.puml` (alts) | Activity “activity_diagram-errors”; State `ERROR→IDLE/OFF` | Components: Core, Comms, Power/BatteryMgr |


### Data Structures

* List: Environment.objects, Environment.sensor_readings (dynamic size, O(n) append).
* Dictionary: Environment.object_index (O(1) lookup by ID, improves search efficiency).
* Stack: Manipulator.grasp_history, MemoryStore.breadcrumbs (LIFO, O(1) push/pop).
* Queue: Navigation.path_queue, CLI.cmd_queue (FIFO, O(1) enqueue/dequeue).

### Automated Testing and Implementation

Developed in PyCharm, robot_system.py uses A* with obstacle avoidance and a dictionary for object lookups (O(1) vs. O(n)). The implementation is linter-optimized with Flake8. Tests in test_robot_system.py cover all scenarios, including edge cases like low battery and timeouts, ensuring robust validation.
