# README Commentary (Rolfe et al., 2001) — 600 words (exact)

WHAT — Implementation versus Unit 7 diagrams. This project delivers a humanoid robot controller mapped to the Unit 7 activity, class, sequence, and state diagrams. The codebase is layered for clarity and testability. The domain layer defines RobotState, Waypoint, EnvObject, Environment, and MemoryStore, plus the PathPlanner contract. In Python, reference counting and cyclic garbage collection (Romano & Kruger, 2021) remove the need for explicit pointers, lowering cognitive and computational overhead relative to C (Cooper, 2022). The services layer provides interchangeable planners (AStarPlanner and GreedyPlanner), a Navigator that orchestrates planning and step execution, a minimal EventBus, and simple actuators (Manipulator, Communicator). The controller coordinates power management, command guards, auto-dock and charging, error recovery, and memory breadcrumbs. The interface provides a CLI queue used by python -m robot. Implemented behaviours include: power transitions (OFF↔IDLE), guarded commands during charging or docking, navigation via A* with a mild obstacle-aware heuristic, a deterministic Greedy baseline for demonstration, manipulation based on nearest-object lookup, communication stubs, deterministic planner timeouts for testability, and recovery from ERROR to IDLE when battery is sufficient. Tests cover navigation success and failure, manipulation success and failure, charging initiation, progression and completion, guard logic, error handling, and planner polymorphism. Evidence is recorded in docs/ (unit-test log, Pylint report, Radon complexity and maintainability).

SO WHAT — Technical rationale, challenges, and evidence. The Strategy pattern isolates algorithmic variance behind PathPlanner, allowing A* and Greedy to be swapped without touching controller logic (Gamma et al., 1995). A* is implemented with a priority queue and a mild obstacle-aware heuristic; this follows standard AI guidance and preserves optimality in grid settings when costs are uniform (Russell and Norvig, 2021). The Navigator encapsulates queueing of steps and exposes a test-friendly drive hook. The controller enforces guards for CHARGING and docking-in-progress to protect invariants. From a quality perspective, static analysis shows predominantly simple, testable code: Radon reports most blocks as A, a small number as B/C, and a single E-rank hotspot in controller.py:tick. According to McCabe (1976), high cyclomatic complexity increases the minimum number of paths to test and risks reduced maintainability. Concentrating control-flow in one method is therefore the principal challenge. Nevertheless, the layered design and dependency injection keep complexity local; planners, navigation, and actuators remain cohesive and loosely coupled. Pylint reports near-perfect style conformance, with deliberate, tightly scoped suppressions only within tests to keep fixtures concise. The test suite demonstrates behavioural coverage across happy paths and error conditions, including deterministic fault injection via planner timeouts. Code maintainability contributes directly to energy efficiency; sustainable refactoring reduces redundant computation and idle CPU time (Şanlıalp, Öztürk & Yiğit, 2022). Collectively, the evidence justifies the chosen techniques, shows alignment with the Unit 7 designs, and highlights exactly where improvement will yield the greatest maintainability gain.

NOW WHAT — Scalable refactoring and quality protection. The next increment is a State refactor that moves behaviour into OffState, IdleState, MovingState, ManipulatingState, ChargingState, and ErrorState. This will break the tick method into cohesive handlers, replacing large conditional blocks with dispatch and guard clauses. Benefits include lower local complexity, clearer invariants per state, fewer accidental fall-throughs, and simpler extension when new capabilities arrive. The refactor preserves existing public contracts and tests; additional tests will validate state transitions and error recovery paths per the Unit 7 state diagram. To protect quality over time, I will 1) define thresholds in CI (Pylint ≥ 9.5, Maintainability Index ≥ 65, zero E/F ranks in production code), 2) capture coverage reports and enforce minimums, and 3) route telemetry hooks through EventBus for observability. I will also extend navigation with injectable heuristics, retaining Strategy while making A* tuning explicit. Finally, I will document the updated diagrams and commit them alongside evidence so the repository remains a self-contained artefact suitable for the e-portfolio. This commentary uses a reflective structure to meet the brief. This commentary uses a reflective structure to meet the brief.

## Complexity analysis (A* vs Greedy)
- **A\*** (uniform grid, 4-neighbour moves): worst case time/space ≈ **O(b^d)**; with a consistent/admissible heuristic, node expansions approach **O(b·d)** in practice; priority queue ops are **O(log n)** per push/pop (Russell & Norvig, 2021).
- **Greedy** best-first step: **O(d)** time when unobstructed, but no optimality guarantees and frequent backtracking or failure under obstacles.

Implication: Strategy lets us swap planners to trade optimality vs speed. Our tests demonstrate both success paths and controlled “no path” via a timeout counter.

## Research integration
Our A* implementation follows the standard best-first formulation with a consistent heuristic (Russell & Norvig, 2021). Strategy enables planner substitution without controller changes (Gamma et al., 1995). Cyclomatic-complexity discussion relies on McCabe (1976) and Maintainability Index links to OO metrics (Chidamber & Kemerer, 1994). The optional adaptive heuristic demonstrates a small, data-driven extension aligned with the literature while keeping interfaces stable.
