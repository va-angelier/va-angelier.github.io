Title: Introduction to Team Project
There will be a discussion/briefing on the assessments for this module. As it involves a team project, you will need to read the Group/Teamwork guidance on the Department's website regarding team roles and the scoring of team activities.
Teams and projects will be assigned and there is a deadline at the end of this week for the final group contract to be agreed by each team. A copy will need to be emailed to the module tutor. If you cannot attend this session, please get in touch with the module tutor as soon as possible.
As part of your preparation for the group work projects, we highly recommend that you start to familiarise yourself with the case study and Appendix 1 and 2 you will be using. This will also be discussed at the seminar.
