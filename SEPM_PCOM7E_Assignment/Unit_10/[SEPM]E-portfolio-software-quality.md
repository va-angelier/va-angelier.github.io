## **Reflection on Software Quality**

Verdugo et al. (2024) conceptualise software quality as an institutionalised and certification-driven practice. Their article documents the 25-year evolution of AQCLab, the first accredited laboratory for software product quality evaluation under the ISO/IEC 25000 (SQuaRE) family of standards. Software quality is framed as a measurable and auditable property, operationalised through repeatable laboratory workflows, formal metrics, and standardised evaluation procedures. The authors emphasise credibility, traceability, and consistency as essential qualities, particularly in compliance-heavy contexts such as public procurement, insurance, and regulated industries. In this model, quality maturity is achieved through procedural stability, accreditation, and alignment with predictive software development lifecycles, where upfront requirements and risk mitigation are prioritised. The underlying assumption is that established quality models, such as ISO/IEC 25010, are sufficiently comprehensive across domains when rigorously applied.

In contrast, Témolé and Atanasova (2025) treat software quality as inherently context-dependent and adaptive. Their study focuses on large organisations undergoing agile transformation and proposes a value chain-oriented Quality Gate Framework that integrates product and process quality across the software development lifecycle. The framework is empirically validated through Grounded Theory based on 58 expert interviews, strengthening its methodological relevance for agile and DevOps environments. Rather than prioritising certification outcomes, the authors emphasise continuous quality gates, stakeholder alignment, and iterative risk management, directly reflecting agile SDLC principles and the dynamic balancing of time, cost, and scope.

The major differences between the two articles are evident in scope, methodology, and orientation to change. Verdugo et al. adopt a cross-domain, governance-centric approach that prioritises reproducibility, external validation, and long-term assurance. By contrast, Témolé and Atanasova privilege empirical adaptability and operational flexibility, explicitly critiquing the rigidity of standard-driven models in fast-changing environments. While Verdugo et al. imply quality maturity through stability and historical continuity, the later article frames maturity as the capacity to respond effectively to evolving risks and organisational constraints.

Overall, Témolé and Atanasova’s framework complements Verdugo et al. by addressing practical limitations of standard-driven quality models in rapidly changing, agile environments. **However**, certification-driven approaches remain indispensable for organisations operating under strict regulatory and contractual obligations. **Consequently**, the two perspectives are best understood as contextually complementary: certification-based quality assurance provides legitimacy and risk control, while adaptive quality management enables responsiveness and continuous improvement in modern software engineering practice.
