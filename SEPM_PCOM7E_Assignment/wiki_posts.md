Agile Scrum

Agile Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework within agile software development that emphasises adaptive planning, early and frequent delivery of value, and continuous improvement through structured feedback. It defines clear accountabilities (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers), events (Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and artefacts (Epics, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment) with associated commitments (Product Goal, Sprint Goal, Definition of Done) (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2020).
Scrum remains widely adopted within agile practices, with 42% of organisations using hybrid models that incorporate Scrum alongside DevOps and other frameworks, demonstrating its adaptability across distributed and hybrid environments (Digital.ai, 2024). Larger organisations show greater adoption of hybrid approaches (49%), while medium-sized companies display a similar preference (45%).
