            <h2>Week 1 – Module Wiki Contribution (LO4)</h2>

            <h4>Learning Outcome: Agile Scrum</h4>

            <p>
                Drawing upon over 25 years of professional experience in software engineering, I have critically
                analysed the transition from traditional Waterfall methodologies to Agile Scrum. Having personally
                experienced this evolution in practice, I recognise Scrum as a highly effective framework that
                enhances adaptability, collaboration, and delivery of value—even when only partially implemented.
            </p>

            <p>
                This activity demonstrates my ability to identify, apply, and evaluate appropriate software
                engineering and project management methodologies within real-world contexts. My reflection confirms
                that Scrum’s principles remain impactful even in hybrid or scaled environments, reinforcing my
                professional conviction in its long-term effectiveness and sustainability.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking forward, I intend to continue integrating Scrum principles—particularly transparency,
                inspection, and adaptation—into complex cross-functional projects to sustain continuous improvement
                and team empowerment.
            </p>

            <h2>Week 2 – Behaviour-Driven Development &amp; Software Quality (LO2, LO3, LO4)</h2>

            <h4>Learning Outcome: Behave, Behaviour-Driven Development</h4>

            <p>
                Engagement with behaviour-driven development (BDD) through the Behave framework provided an
                opportunity to apply a structured testing methodology within a realistic project context. The
                declarative Given–When–Then syntax initially required adjustment, as it contrasted with traditional
                imperative programming practices. Working through this difference revealed how behavioural
                specifications expressed in natural language can translate complex technical requirements into
                shared, verifiable expectations.
            </p>

            <p>
                This experience demonstrated the communicative value of BDD in bridging the gap between developers
                and other stakeholders, improving mutual understanding of system behaviour. The modular separation
                between feature descriptions and step implementations highlighted clear benefits for maintainability
                and transparency across the software life cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
                This activity aligns with Learning Outcomes 2, 3 and 4 of the module by applying a professional tool
                to manage software quality, promoting collaborative understanding of roles and responsibilities, and
                critically evaluating software engineering methodologies that ensure reliable outcomes.
            </p>
