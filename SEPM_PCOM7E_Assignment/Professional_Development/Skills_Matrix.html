                This skills matrix reflects the professional competencies developed and demonstrated
                during the SEPM_PCOM7E module. Each skill is evaluated in relation to module activities,
                teamwork, and applied project management practice.

                        I intentionally did not take on a leadership role in this module due to limited capacity.
                        This affected my level of contribution and, in hindsight, likely contributed to a lower outcome
                        (6.4 compared to my usual average of 7.4). The key learning is to proactively negotiate a realistic
                        role early (e.g., smaller but clearly owned responsibilities) and communicate constraints transparently
                        to protect both team delivery and individual performance.
