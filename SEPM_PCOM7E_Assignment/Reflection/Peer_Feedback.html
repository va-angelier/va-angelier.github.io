<h2>Peer Feedback and Team Evaluation</h2>

<p>
    Peer feedback was collected using the official University of Essex Online
    peer evaluation template. This feedback was not shared with team members,
    but contributed to the final assessment of the group assignment.
</p>

<h3>Summary of peer feedback</h3>

<p>
    Overall, the team demonstrated effective collaboration, adaptability,
    and consistent delivery despite early ambiguity in role allocation.
    Feedback highlighted strong communication, cooperative attitudes,
    and high-quality outputs across all phases of the project.
</p>

<h3>Key strengths identified</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Constructive and consistent communication</li>
    <li>Willingness to take responsibility outside prior expertise</li>
    <li>Strong cooperative attitude and psychological safety</li>
</ul>

<h3>Areas for improvement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Earlier formalisation of roles and decision-making authority</li>
    <li>More consistent attendance during critical milestones</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal reflection</h3>

<p>
    This peer feedback confirmed the importance of explicit governance
    mechanisms in collaborative software engineering projects.
    While informal coordination was sufficient in later stages,
    earlier role clarity would have reduced initial inefficiencies.
    These insights directly inform my professional development action plan.
