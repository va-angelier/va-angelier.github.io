                <h3>Learning Outcome 4 – Professional Practice and Teamwork</h3>
                <h4>Module: Software Engineering Project Management (SEPM_PCOM7E)</h4>

            <p>
                This reflective piece addresses <strong>Learning Outcome 4</strong>, which focuses on the
                development and application of professional skills required to operate effectively as a member
                of a software development team in a virtual and professional environment. The reflection draws
                upon my experiences throughout the SEPM_PCOM7E module, including teamwork, role selection,
                communication, and professional self-management.

            <h2>Context and team environment</h2>

            <p>
                The SEPM module was delivered in a distributed, virtual team setting, reflecting contemporary
                software engineering practice. Collaboration occurred through structured discussions, shared
                artefacts, and coordinated project activities across multiple units. The environment required
                clear communication, shared accountability, and effective role allocation to ensure progress
                under time and quality constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the outset, the team faced typical challenges associated with virtual collaboration,
                including asynchronous communication, varying availability, and differences in experience and
                expectations. These factors made role clarity and capacity management particularly important.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>Role selection and professional judgement</h2>

            <p>
                In contrast to previous modules and professional contexts where I often assume leadership or
                coordination responsibilities, I made a deliberate decision in this module not to take on a
                formal or informal leadership role. This decision was driven by limited personal capacity during
                the module and an assessment that overcommitment would negatively affect both team outcomes and
                my own performance.
            </p>

            <p>
                While this choice reduced immediate cognitive and organisational load, it also limited my level
                of influence on planning, prioritisation, and decision-making within the team. In retrospect,
                this contributed to a less prominent contribution than is typical for me and is likely reflected
                in the final outcome for the module (6.4), compared to my usual academic average (7.4).
            </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>Reflection on impact and learning</h2>

            <p>
                This experience highlighted that opting out of leadership does not remove responsibility for
                managing expectations, visibility, and contribution. Although the decision was rational from a
                capacity perspective, I underestimated the importance of explicitly negotiating an alternative,
                well-defined role with clearly owned deliverables.
            </p>

            <p>
                The key learning is that professional effectiveness in team environments is not solely dependent
                on taking leadership roles, but on ensuring that one’s role—whatever it may be—is visible,
                bounded, and aligned with both personal capacity and team needs. Passive participation, even when
                well-intentioned, can reduce perceived contribution and impact outcomes.
            </p>

            <h2>Professional development and future application</h2>

            <p>
                As a result of this reflection, I have identified concrete actions for future team-based projects.
                These include early and explicit role negotiation, transparent communication of constraints, and
                the ownership of smaller but clearly defined responsibilities when full leadership roles are not
                appropriate.
            </p>

            <p>
                This approach aligns with professional project management practice and supports sustainable
                contribution without compromising quality or personal well-being. The reflection directly
                informs my Professional Development Plan and contributes to my ongoing development as a reflective
                and responsible software engineering professional.
            </p>
