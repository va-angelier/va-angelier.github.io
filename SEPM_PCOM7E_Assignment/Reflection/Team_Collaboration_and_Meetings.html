                This page provides evidence of my collaboration and early project coordination activities
                during the SEPM_PCOM7E group project. It complements the LO4 reflective piece and supports
                the broader evidence base for project governance, communication, and teamwork.

            <h2>Team collaboration and early project coordination (Weeks 1–2)</h2>

            <p>
                During the initial phase of the SEPM group project, I assumed a coordinating role to enable
                the team to start effectively. In weeks 1 and 2, I facilitated the kick-off meetings,
                documented decisions, and addressed communication barriers caused by platform and GDPR
                constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
                These early meetings focused on team formation, communication channels, risk identification,
                and the drafting of the group contract. I initiated the use of alternative communication
                tools and ensured that risks related to reduced participation were identified and discussed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once roles were formally assigned and the group contract was finalised, I consciously stepped
                back from an informal leadership position. This decision was intentional and aligned with the
                agreed role distribution, allowing the designated project lead to take responsibility. The
                experience provided a practical insight into situational leadership, role boundaries, and
                the importance of early governance structures in distributed software projects.
            </p>

            <h2>Unit 4 Wiki contribution</h2>

            <p>
                In Unit 4, I contributed directly to the module wiki by analysing enterprise risk drivers
                and mapping them to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). My contribution focused on
                governance-related risks, including fragmented risk ownership and weak early-stage oversight,
                and proposed mitigation measures aligned with formal risk management frameworks.
            </p>

            <p>
                This activity required synthesising academic literature with practical project management
                concepts discussed across the module, particularly risk identification, analysis and
                treatment. The contribution demonstrates my engagement in collaborative knowledge creation
                and my ability to translate theoretical models into actionable project-level guidance.
            </p>
