# Collaborative Discussion 2 – Summary (Unit 4)

## Topic
The second collaborative discussion focused on the identification, categorisation and mitigation of software project risks, with specific emphasis on privacy, governance and enterprise-level risk management. The discussion drew on academic literature, including Anton and Afloarei Nucu (2020), and practical risk frameworks introduced earlier in the module, particularly those from Unit 3.

A key theme was how abstract enterprise risks (e.g. governance weakness, financial instability, and organisational structure) translate into concrete risks across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and how structured frameworks can be used to manage these risks systematically.

## My contribution
My contribution centred on integrating academic risk literature with practical SDLC-aligned frameworks. In the module wiki and summary post, I analysed how the enterprise-level risks synthesised by Anton and Afloarei Nucu (2020) can be mapped onto SDLC phases, highlighting their impact on requirements stability, architectural quality and long-term maintenance.

I further contributed by evaluating NIST privacy engineering tools during the Unit 4 seminar activity, demonstrating how the NIST Privacy Framework and NISTIR 8062 extend traditional risk assessment methods from Unit 3. I argued that these tools provide engineer-oriented, lifecycle-based mechanisms for identifying and mitigating privacy risks early, rather than treating privacy as a purely compliance-driven concern.

## Key learning
This discussion reinforced the importance of viewing software project risks as systemic rather than isolated technical issues. I developed a deeper understanding of how governance, organisational context and privacy considerations interact with technical decision-making throughout the SDLC. The collaborative exchange strengthened my ability to synthesise academic research with practical frameworks and apply them coherently within a professional software engineering context.
