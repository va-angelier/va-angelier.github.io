Learning Outcome: Agile Scrum

Drawing upon over 25 years of professional experience in software engineering, I have critically analysed the transition from traditional Waterfall methodologies to Agile Scrum. Having personally experienced this evolution in practice, I recognise Scrum as a highly effective framework that enhances adaptability, collaboration, and delivery of value—even when only partially implemented.

This activity demonstrates my ability to identify, apply, and evaluate appropriate software engineering and project management methodologies within real-world contexts. My reflection confirms that Scrum’s principles remain impactful even in hybrid or scaled environments, reinforcing my professional conviction in its long-term effectiveness and sustainability.

Looking forward, I intend to continue integrating Scrum principles—particularly transparency, inspection, and adaptation—into complex cross-functional projects to sustain continuous improvement and team empowerment.
