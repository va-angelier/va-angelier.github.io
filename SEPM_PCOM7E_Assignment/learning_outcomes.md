Learning Outcome: Agile Scrum

Drawing upon over 25 years of professional experience in software engineering, I have critically analysed the transition from traditional Waterfall methodologies to Agile Scrum. Having personally experienced this evolution in practice, I recognise Scrum as a highly effective framework that enhances adaptability, collaboration, and delivery of value—even when only partially implemented.

This activity demonstrates my ability to identify, apply, and evaluate appropriate software engineering and project management methodologies within real-world contexts. My reflection confirms that Scrum’s principles remain impactful even in hybrid or scaled environments, reinforcing my professional conviction in its long-term effectiveness and sustainability.

Looking forward, I intend to continue integrating Scrum principles—particularly transparency, inspection, and adaptation—into complex cross-functional projects to sustain continuous improvement and team empowerment.

## Week 2 – Behavioural Driven Development & Software Quality (L02, LO3, LO4)

```
Learning Outcome: Behave, Behavioural Driven Development

Engagement with behaviour-driven development (BDD) through the Behave framework provided an opportunity to apply a structured testing methodology within a realistic project context. The declarative Given–When–Then syntax initially required adjustment, as it contrasted with traditional imperative programming practices. Working through this difference revealed how behavioural specifications expressed in natural language can translate complex technical requirements into shared, verifiable expectations. 

This experience demonstrated the communicative value of BDD in bridging the gap between developers and other stakeholders, improving mutual understanding of system behaviour. The modular separation between feature descriptions and step implementations highlighted clear benefits for maintainability and transparency across the software life cycle.

This activity aligns with Learning Outcomes 2, 3 and 4 of the module by applying a professional tool to manage software quality, promoting collaborative understanding of roles and responsibilities, and critically evaluating software engineering methodologies that ensure reliable outcomes.
